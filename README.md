# Only use this selfbot in private servers such as ones with only you and the bot in, the selfbot cant detect if you spawn the pokemon or if someone else does so if you use it in public servers it will try to catch pokemon that other people spawn in

# How to use
```
• Download the .rar file from the [download link in download.txt](https://github.com/ParrotSecurity9/PokeMeowSelfbot/main/download.txt)
• Unzip the .rar file
• Put your discord token in the Config.yaml file and save the file
• Run the PokemeowSelfbot.exe
• Start the bot
• Type '.start' in the channel you wish to run the bot in
• Let the bot idle and catch pokemon for you, but watchout for the captchas as the bot will stop and alert you when a captcha appers but will not complete the captcha for you
